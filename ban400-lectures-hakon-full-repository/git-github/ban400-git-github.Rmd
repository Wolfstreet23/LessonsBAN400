## Brief review of the video lectures

- In the video lectures related to this session we give a brief introduction to the main functionality of Git and Github. 

### Git

- Git is an open source, light-weight, and powerful system for *version control*. 
- Git keeps track of the state of all the files in a project over time and works essentially as a time machine. We can easily navigate the history of the entire project and return to an earlier point if needed.
- Git lets us work on several *branches*. This lets us develop experimental features without touching a working/stable project, which can be merged into the main branch when tested and ready.
- Git comes with tools for handling merge conflicts.

---

### Github

- Online (commercial, owned by Microsoft) service hosting git repositories.
- Comes with additional features such as *project management and team collaboration*, *releases*, *forks* and *pull requests*.
- Students get free access to GitHub Pro, which includes the possibility of keeping private repositories: [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
- There are alternatives, most notably **GitLab** which is in orbit around (but not owned by) Google.
- ... and  many more: [Wikipedia: comparison of source-code-hosting facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source-code-hosting_facilities)

### Interface

- We use the terminal to work with git and SSH authentication. This is pretty standard, and stable over time: You can expect that this workflow will work for a long time.
- The terminal provides the same interface for all platforms.
- There are GUIs, paid (i.e. [GitKraken](gitkraken.com)) and free (i.e. the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)).
- [There are other options as well](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)

### Basic terminal commands  

|          |                         |
| -------- | ------------------      |
| `ls`     | List files              |
| `cd`     | Change directory        |
| `pwd`    | Print working directory |
| `..`     | One step up             |

### Basic git commands

Most of these commands take additional arguments:

|                           |                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git init`                | Initialize git repository in this folder                        |
| `git add .`               | Move all files in working directory to the staging area         |
| `git commit -m "Message"` | Commit to history, with commit message                          |
| `git log`                 | Log of recent commits                                           |
| `git pull`                | Update offline rep with the latest version from the online repo |
| `git clone`               | Download repo from online source                                |
| `git push`                | Push latest commit to online repo                               |
| `git checkout -b`         | Make a new branch                                               |
| `git merge`               | Merge branch into the current branch                            |
| `git reset`               | Go back in time and restore an earlier version of the project   |

### Workflow in data science projects

- Does Git/Github fit into your workflow?
- What kind of projects/tasks fit into at git-based workflow?
- What kind of projects/tasks **do not** fit into at git-based workflow (at least as far as we understand it now)?
- Some [Git best practices:](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/):
    - "Commit often, perfect later, publish once."
    - "Don't change published history." 
    - "Release tagging"

### Moving on: forks and pull requests

- One thing is to manage a small coding project, either on our own or in a small group, using Git and Github.
- Git and Github (and similar services) also provide tools to really unleash the possibility of open source development.
- We will look specifically at
    - **Forking**: Create a linked copy of a Github repository on your own account. You can do whatever you want with this, but also pull the latest version and merge that with your own work.
    - **Pull request**: Request to merge your changes back into the main repository.
